# Shopping Bag

The project consists of a simulation of an e-commerce platform for selling clothes. It uses Axios to consume the API from FakeStoreAPI, from which it retrieves clothing prices and photos. In this application, users can select the clothes they want to purchase, specify quantities, and the total value is automatically displayed in the shopping cart of the application.
To apply knowledge gained from courses, Vuex was employed as a state management solution, and user-generated information is stored in the browser's local storage.
